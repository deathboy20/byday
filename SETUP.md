# ByDay Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the ByDay job marketplace application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works fine)
- Git (optional, for version control)

## Step 1: Supabase Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Fill in your project details
   - Wait for the project to be created (takes ~2 minutes)

2. **Get Your API Keys**
   - In your Supabase project dashboard, go to Settings â†’ API
   - Copy the following:
     - Project URL (looks like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
     - `anon` public key (starts with `eyJ...`)

3. **Run the Database Setup Script**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
   - Click "New Query"
   - Copy the entire contents of `scripts/setup-database.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute the script
   - This will create all tables, indexes, RLS policies, and triggers

## Step 2: Environment Variables

1. **Create `.env.local` file**
   - In the root of your project, create a file named `.env.local`
   - Copy the contents from `.env.local.example`
   - Fill in your Supabase credentials:

\`\`\`env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

## Step 4: Run the Development Server

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Step 5: Test the Application
