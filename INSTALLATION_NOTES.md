# ByDay Platform - Installation Notes

## Required Package Installation

To enable PDF report generation in the Admin Dashboard, you need to install the following packages:

```bash
npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Why `--legacy-peer-deps`?

The project uses Vite 7.x which may have peer dependency conflicts with some packages. Using `--legacy-peer-deps` allows npm to bypass strict peer dependency resolution.

## Recent Updates

### 1. Fixed Jobs Page Infinite Refresh
- **Issue**: The `/jobs` page was continuously refreshing and reloading
- **Cause**: Real-time subscription in `useJobUpdates` hook was triggering unnecessary re-renders
- **Fix**: 
  - Added unique channel names for subscriptions
  - Implemented filter validation before updating state
  - Changed dependency array to use `JSON.stringify(filters)` to prevent unnecessary effect re-runs

### 2. Replaced Native Alerts with Custom UI Components
- **Issue**: Native `confirm()` and `alert()` dialogs don't match the application UI
- **Fix**: 
  - Replaced `confirm()` in AdminDashboard with custom `AlertDialog` component
  - All confirmations now use shadcn/ui AlertDialog components
  - Consistent with the existing UI design system

### 3. Admin Dashboard Improvements
- **Data Fetching**: Already properly fetches data from Supabase backend
- **CRUD Operations**: 
  - ✅ View users and jobs
  - ✅ Verify/unverify users
  - ✅ Delete jobs (with custom confirmation dialog)
  - ✅ Real-time data updates

### 4. PDF Report Generation
- **Feature**: Generate professional PDF reports with custom branding
- **Reports Available**:
  - User Report: Complete platform statistics with user details
  - Client Report: Client-specific activity and job postings
- **Customization**:
  - ByDay branding with blue header
  - Platform title and logo
  - Formatted tables with statistics
  - Professional layout with page numbers
  - Custom filename with date

## File Changes

### Modified Files:
1. `src/hooks/useJobUpdates.ts` - Fixed infinite refresh issue
2. `src/pages/dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Added custom dialogs and PDF generation
3. `src/pages/dashboard/ClientDashboard.tsx` - Already uses custom AlertDialog (no changes needed)

### New Files:
1. `src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts` - PDF report generation utility

## Testing

After installing the required packages, test the following:

1. **Jobs Page**: Navigate to `/jobs` and verify it doesn't continuously refresh
2. **Admin Dashboard**: 
   - Test user verification toggle
   - Test job deletion with confirmation dialog
   - Generate user report (should download PDF)
   - Generate client report (should download PDF)
3. **UI Consistency**: All alerts and confirmations should use custom dialogs

## Next Steps

1. Run the installation command above
2. Restart the development server
3. Test all functionality
4. Review PDF reports for any customization needs
