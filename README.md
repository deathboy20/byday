Build a location-based daily jobs platform that enables:

Clients to post small, short-term tasks.

Workers to discover, accept, and complete tasks.

A clean, fast, mobile-first web experience to validate real demand before scaling.

Your MVP should prove three things:

People will use the system to find or post daily jobs.

The matching and rating flow works seamlessly.

The pricing and trust system (reviews, basic verification) is enough to keep users returning.
